# Game Theory
### 1. Introduction

**1.1 Definition**
*What is Game Theory?*
Game Theory is the mathematical theory of interactive decisions. It analysis situations where: 
- there is a group of agents;
- each agent has to make a choice
- the choices of all the agents lead to the outcome of the interaction
- agents have preferences over the possible outcomes.

Game theory studies situations where for one or more individuals the outcomes of an action taken by one of them depends not only on the action taken by that individual, but also on the actions taken by the others. It is a branch of applied mathematics that studies interactive situations using mathematical model called games. 

**Key words**: 
- **Game**: it is an abstract version of reality, a scenario where agents interact, following some rules.
- **Player**: a participant in the game.
- **Strategy**: a complete plan of action. It tells a player what to do in all possible situations/outcomes of the game.
- **Payoff**: it measures how well a player does in the game. It can be expressed in monotory? term. Payoff is what a player gets at the end of the game. It can be a win, a loss, a reward or a punishment.
- **Utility**: it measures the satisfaction of players.
- **Equilibrium Strategy**: it is the best strategy for a player. It gives the highest payoff given the choices of the other players.

The name of subject derives of the fundamental book by Von Neumann. The main applications are in economics and social sciences , but there are also applications in computer science, security, biology. 

**1.2 Classifications of games**
*Non cooperative games*: the goal of each player is to maximize the payoff. They are static games, sequential games, repeated games, games with incomplete information, Stockelberg games, auctions etc.


| Non cooperative games | Cooperative games |

|  --------  |  -------  |

| The goal of each player is to maximize the payoff | The goal is to cooperate to gain more profit |

| Static games, sequential games, repeated games, games with incomplete information, Stockelberg games, auctions | Bargaining games, transferable utility games, Non-transferable utility games, elections |

| Dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium, Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, Min/max solutions | Imputations, core, Shapley value |
